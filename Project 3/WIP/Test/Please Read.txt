I was able to get this working before, but something went wrong with my computer before I could save the files. The databases are located in the repositories Project3java and Project3html.  I don't have the chance to completely fix everything like I did before, but I hope that what I was able to do can show that I am capable of completing the project again if I had more time. Also, for the html questions, on the json website it says that the character limit is too long. I got it to work when I had fewer questions, so I believe that is the issue on that end.
